A repository to collect papers and programs of historical interest to AI. Mostly gathered while reading Pamela McCorduck's Machines Who Think

## Turing - Computing Machinery and Intelligence (1950)
Turing's seminal AI work... A nice read with a curious section about ESP!
[Paper](./Papers/Turing%20(1950)%20-%20Computing%20Machinery%20and%20Intelligence.pdf)
    
## Shannon - A Chess-Playing Machine (1950)
Claude Shannon's original 1950 paper...

An article in Scientific American. Super readable...

## Newell, Simon & Shaw - The Logic Theory Machine (1956)
[Paper](Papers/Newell%20&%20Simon%20%281956%29%20-%20The%20Logic%20Theory%20Machine.pdf)
	
Proved 38 of the first 52 theorems in Russell & Whitehead's Principia Mathematica and even found a new and better proof for one.

Source Code has not been transcribed and doesn't appear to be easily available.

## Newell, Simon & Shaw - Chess-Playing Programs and the Problem of Complexity (1958)
[Paper](./Papers/Newell,%20Shaw,%20Simon%20(1958)%20-%20Chess-Playing%20Programs%20and%20the%20Problem%20of%20Complexity.pdf)

## Green, Wolf, Chomsky, Laughery (1961) - BASEBALL - An Automatic Question-Answerer
[Paper](./Papers/Green,%20Wolf,%20Chomsky,%20Laughery%20(1961)%20-%20BASEBALL%20-%20An%20Automatic%20Question-Answerer.pdf)

This program could answer questions about baseball (for a specific year) specified in plain english using syntactic analysis...

## Lindsay (1963) - Inferential Memory as the Basis of Machines Which Understand Natural Language (SAD SAM)
[Paper](./Papers/Lindsay%20(1963)%20-%20Inferential%20Memory%20as%20the%20Basis%20of%20Machines%20Which%20Understand%20Natural%20Language.pdf)

Hardly mentioned in the paper, which is more of an early analysis (an excellent one) of the difficulties of natural language processing, is SAD SAM which was the name of the program which could examine kinship relations.
